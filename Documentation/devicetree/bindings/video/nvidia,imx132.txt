NVIDIA Camera sensor imx132 driver interface.

Required properties:
- compatible : The driver is compatible with
	"nvidia,imx132".

- cam2_gpios : Camera GPIO.

- reg: Should contain I2C slave address of the driver.

- nvidia,ext_reg : For few platforms this driver needs extra power regulators
to be enabled. This bool property indicates the same. It must be programmed
only when imx132 driver needs extra power rails for particular platform.

Example:

	imx132@36 {
		compatible = "nvidia,imx132";
		cam2_gpios = <&gpio 222 0>; /* gpio PBB6 */
		reg = <0x36>;
		nvidia,ext_reg; /* Extra power-regulators needed */
		status = "okay";
	};
