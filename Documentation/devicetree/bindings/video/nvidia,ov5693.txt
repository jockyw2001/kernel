NVIDIA Camera sensor ov5693 driver interface.

Properties:
- compatible : The driver is compatible with
	"nvidia,ov5693".

- reg : Should contain I2C slave address of the driver.

- nvidia,num : Indicates the instance of particular camera device, in this
case it is for camera sensor device. Currently for rear camera sensor "0"
is used.

- nvidia,dev-name : Camera device driver name.

- nvidia,use-vcm-vdd : For few platforms this driver needs extra power
regulator "ext_vcm_vdd" to be enabled. This bool property indicates the
same. It must be programmed only when ov5693 driver needs it for a
particular platform.

- reset-gpios : ov5693 reset GPIO

Example:

	ov5693@10 {
		compatible = "nvidia,ov5693";
		reg = <0x10>;
		nvidia,num = <0>;
		nvidia,dev-name = "camera";
		nvidia,use-vcm-vdd;
		reset-gpios = <&gpio 219 0>; /* gpio PBB3 */
		status = "okay";
	};
