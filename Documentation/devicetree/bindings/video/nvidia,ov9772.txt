NVIDIA Camera sensor ov9772 driver interface.

Required properties:
- compatible : The driver is compatible with
	"nvidia,ov9772".

- reg: Should contain I2C slave address of the driver.

- nvidia,dev_name: Indicates device name.

- nvidia,num: Indicates device number.

- nvidia,vcm_vdd : For few platforms this driver needs extra power
regulator (vcm_vdd) to be enabled. This bool property indicates the
same. It must be programmed only when ov9772 driver needs extra power
rail for a platform in context.

Example:

	ov9772@10 {
		compatible = "nvidia,ov9772";
		reg = <0x10>;
		nvidia,num = <1>;

		nvidia,vcm_vdd; /* extra regulator needed */

		/* ov9772 gpios */
		reset-gpios = <&gpio 219 0>; /* gpio PBB3 */
		power-gpios = <&gpio 222 0>; /* gpio PBB6 */

		nvidia,dev_name = "camera";
		status = "okay";
	};
