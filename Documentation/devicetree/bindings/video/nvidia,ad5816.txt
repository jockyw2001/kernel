NVIDIA Camera sensor ad5816 driver interface.

Required properties:
- compatible : The driver is compatible with
	"nvidia,ad5816".

- reg: Should contain I2C slave address of the driver.

All other properties are based on nvc (nvidia camera interface) standard
structures definitions, which are generic across the devices. Few of them are
explained below:

- nvidia,num: Indicates the instance of particular camera device, in this case
it is for camera focuser device. Currently for rear camera focuser "0" is used.

- nvidia,sync: Used for stereo synchronization. "0" for non-stereo usecase.

- nvidia,dev_name: Camera device driver name.

Example:

	ad5816@0E {
		compatible = "nvidia,ad5816";
		reg = <0x0E>;
		nvidia,cfg = <0>;
		nvidia,num = <0>;
		nvidia,sync = <0>;
		nvidia,dev_name = "focuser";
		status = "okay";
	};
