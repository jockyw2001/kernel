System-EDP Battery Monitor

Required properties:
- compatible : "nvidia,tegra124-sysedp_batmon_calc"
- ocv_lut: The property contains several sets of combinations of
  capacity battery remained and battery open-circuit-voltage (in uV).
  Take <60 7641110> for exmaple, it means the battery
  open-circuit-voltage is 7641.11mV when battery remained capacity is
  60%. Entries must be in descending order wrt capacity and last entry
  must be <0 ...>.
- update_interval: The defines the period (in ms) for system to update the
  available power budget.
- ibat_lut: This defines the maximum allowed current (in mA) from the
  battery under specific temperature. The property contains several
  sets of combinations of temperature and current with the format of
  <C mA>. C is the temperature in Celcius, negative values reprented
  with 2's complement. mA is the maximum current battery can supply
  under this temperature. Take <60 6150> for example, this means that
  battery can supply 6150mA when temperature is 60 degree
  Celsius. Entries must be in descending order wrt temperature and
  last entry must be <... 0>.
- rbat_data: An array of battery impedance (in uOhm) under different temperatures
  and capacity.
- temp_axis: An array of different temperatures. Negative values are
  represented with 2's complement
- capacity_axis: An array of capacity battery remains.
- power_supply : The name of system power supply.
- r_const: This value describes the system impedance(in uOhm).
- vsys_min: The minmum voltage (in uV) needed for PMIC.
