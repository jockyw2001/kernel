NVIDIA Tegra30 DVFS tables

dvfs-tables node:
All the tables must be contained in dvfs-tables parent node. This node is just
container for all dvfs tables, it does not have any compatible property.

Tables:
Required properties for child nodes of dvfs-tables:

compatible: Must be any of
		"nvidia,tegra30-cpu-dvfs" for CPU dvfs tables or
		"nvidia,tegra30-cpu0-dvfs" for cpu0 dvfs tables or
		"nvidia,tegra30-core-dvfs" for core dvfs tables.

voltage-table: Voltage steps for rail. Unit for voltage value is mV.

#address-cells: Should be 0.
#size-cells: Should be 1.

Frequency tables:

Frequency tables are grouped using the combination of speedo-id, process-id and manual-dvfs.

Required properties:

reg: Can be any number but same as used in node name. Should be unique within the dvfs table.
clock-name: Clock name for which frequencies are mentioned in table.
frequencies: Array of frequencies. Unit for frequency is KHz.

Optional properties:
speedo-id: If not present, speedo id value will be -1.
process-id: If not present, process id value will be -1.
manual-dvfs: If not present, dvfs for the clocks in this frequency table is auto.

Example:

        dvfs-tables {
                cpudvfs {
                        compatible = "nvidia,tegra30-cpu-dvfs";
                        voltage-table = <800 825 850 875 900 916 950 975 1000 1007 1025 1050 1075 1100 1125 1150 1175 1200 1212 1237>;

			frequency-table@1 {
				reg = <1>;
				speedo-id = <0>;
				process-id = <0>;
				clock-name = "cpu_g";
				frequencies = <1 1 684000 684000 817000 817000 817000 1026000 1102000 1102000 1149000 1187000 1225000 1282000 1300000>;
			};
		};
	};
